# Comment 1
There is a minor error in the scientific description of the CABLE soil model used by CCAM (e.g., there are
more parameters than listed in the table), but this does not have any impact on the analysis on conclusions.

# Comment 2
It may have been beneficial to indicate the direction of future work, such as comparing to alternative 
reanalysis or global climate model products (e.g., how well does CCAM perform compared to a GCM).

## Response
Compare the result with the observation at some sites;
Compare the result with global reanalysis and global climate model if any available dataset.

## Modeified Text

Future studies:
We would explore the performance of observed soil moisture from the site located at Hobart, and compare the 
performance with the result from CCAM and BARRA-TA.

# Comment 3
The thesis analysis is limited to mainly plotting outputs from models and performing limited temporal and 
spatial analysis – mainly correlations.

## Response

Time series, statistical plot

# Comment 4

Almost all the analysis is not introduced and so it is left to the reader to guess why certain calculations 
are being done and what they inform us. In several cases the analysis in the text was brief and just 
described the major features of the figures rather than adding substantially to them with critical thought.

## Response

Descript method and figure more specifically.

# Comment 5
The analysis of the projections in Chapter 2 was very brief. The analysis did not lead me to be confident 
in the conclusion “Supported by BARRA-TA, CCAM can be confident to project the future change in the region,
where the soil moisture will decrease fast (more than 10 % approximately).” This may be the case, but I 
did not fell the analysis confirmed this, given the differences at the 10 % level in soil moisture between 
the two models (if I understand Figure 6 correctly).

## Response

Again, the analysis is not serious enough. Should we add more analysis on the temporal and spatial 
distribution?

# Comment 6

Some remaining English issues but entirely understandable in the main. The complex parts of the methods 
description in Chapter 2.2.3 were, however, to brief, and not precise enough, to understand what occurred at 
many of the steps. In this section it is stated that correlations are computed by linear regression – 
something that is not a correct description of how correlations are computed.

## Response

For the “processing” part, there should add more description in detail.

The method needs to be improved. Just correlation seems not enough.

# Comment 7

The discussion of key results in Figure 4 and 5 (Chapter 2) is very limited (just a paragraph or so each). 
These sentences generally just describe the large scale features rather than delve into what is actually 
going on. The caption of Figure 5 was not clear enough for me to understand the figure – mainly because the 
x-axis was not labelled (it is not clear to me why this is the best way to analyse these data).

## Response

The related variables can be ignored actually.

# Comment 8

For figure 6, again the discussion could have been a little longer. The offset between BARRA-TA and the other
models was not commented on for instance. I do not understand what ‘value’ is plotted on the x-axes of
Figure6, and are they normalized or unitless for some other reason? While the soil moisture data are said (
in the caption) to come from the middle of the layer, they are potted at the layer boundary.

## Response

Modify Figure 6, this is too simple.

# Comment 9

Figure 7: This is nicely drawn. The effect of moving to from JULES to ACCESS-G in BARRA-TA is large – the 
effect of this change suggests a significant and it would have been nice to have some more discussion. It 
would have been nice to flag this right at the beginning and then only show data up to 2014

## Response

Actually, this is what we found. Or there are better way to represent it.

# Comment 10
Figure 8: a discrete (discontinuous) color scale would have the interpretation of this figure

## Response

How to work out it?

# Comment 11
Section 2.3.3: the rationale for the calculations reported in this chapter is not explained. This applies 
to several sections of Chapter 2

## Response
The evidence why we should take these methods.

# Comment 12

Figure 10: it is not clear why 0.9 was adopted as a threshold. The caption refers to it being a ‘critical’ 
point.

## Response
Have been explained in the 2.3.3, maybe not significant enough.

# Comment 13

Some of the Discussion reads more like conclusions, but overall the discussion is quite good.

# Comment 14

The two grid cells discussion in Section 2.3.1 are not shown on a map, so it makes their interpretation 
impossible. The rationale for choosing these cells, especially the eastern one, is not clear and insufficient
evidence is shown to support their choice.

## Response

The way to take the two grid cells is not serious. Change it into another way, or delete it.

# Comment 15

Did not understand the sentence about temperature having a smaller range and hence possible larger 
correlations (with what? And why?)

## Response

Explain the theory of least square regression or delete the comparison with related variables.

# Comment 16

P42 “Here is the statistics of the spatial pattern of these correlations.” Is not a complete sentence.

## Response

Here we did the statistics of the spatial correlation within related variables.

# Comment 17

Figure 2 (Chapter 2) caption is not entirely clear. It suggests percentages but then says they are rescaled 
(which I think means normalized to 0-1) but this is not clear. It is not clear how the normalization was 
performed.

## Response
Explain the rescaling.

# Comment 18

Figure 10 is referenced in the text before Figure 9.

## Response

Change the text if necessary

# Overall, we need to change almost all method, and need strong evidence to prove it.
