# Figure 1
![Figure 1](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure1.png)
## Importance
* Represent the difference of soil types between CCAM models and BARRA-TA;
* Indicate than soil texture in the same region might be different between CCAM models and BARRA-TA.
## What we expected
* Similar soil type (soil texture) between CCAM models and BARRA-TA.
## What we found
* Soil type in BARRA is more complicated than in CCAM models;
* The distribution of soil type is different between BARRA-TA and CCAM models.

# Figure 2 and Figure 3

![Figure 3](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure3.png)
## Importance
As an example, it can present the relationship between soil moisture and related variables, and present the different relationship between west and east region.
But it doesn't have direct connection with the assessment of soil moisture.
## What we expected
We expect these two figures (Figure 2 and Figure 3) can help us explain the distribution of different correlation between east and west region.
## What we found
We found there is more random and lower values in the east region, and the relationship between soil moisture and the related variables is more random in the east region.
# Figure 4
![Figure 4](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure4.png)
## Importance
It can present the correlation between soil moisture and related variables over each grid cell by the annual cycle.
It can show the relationship between soil moisture and relative variables between different regions and between different models.
Explore the relationship between soil moisture and related variables doesn't have too much help fro assessing soil moisture.
## What we expected
We expect to explore the reason why there are different correlation of soil moisture between west and east region.
But it seems not to convinced.
## What we found
We found that the tendency between soil moisture and the related variables has similar distribution with the tendency of soil moisture between models.
But it is hard to build a confident link between soil moisture and the related variables.
And the CCAM-ensemble's value coule be split into six individual models' value.
# Figure 5
![Figure 5](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure5.png)
## Importance
It can show the high link between soil moisture and related variables.
From this, we could get more understanding about how closed relationship between soil moisture and related variables through different models.
## What we expected
We expected that we can do the statistics about the correlation over all grid cells between models and get more confidence for the relationship between soil moisture and related variables.
## What we found
We only found that there is different weight between models.
And the most we found is the relationship of soil moisture with related variables rather than assessing soil moisture itself.
# Figure 6
![Figure 6](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure6.png)
## Importance
This figure shows the average soil moisture values at different layers, models and periods.
Also, it can present the change after layer's transformation.
## What we expected
We excepted the comparison is acceptable after transforming the six original layers into four new layers.
## What we found?
We got that the top two new two layers are more reliable than the bottom two new layers.
And it is acceptable for the transformation from the six layers into four new layers.
# Figure 7
![Figure 7](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure7.png)
## Importance
It can show the monthly time series and then present the different tendency between two periods.
Also, the magnitude of values from CCAM models and BARRA-TA and different.
## What we expected
The time series of BARRA-TA and CCAM models should be closed.
## What we found
* BARRA got higher magnitude than CCAM models apart from the last two years at layer 3 and layer 4;
* The time series of last two years at bottom layers are biased than the surface two layers.
* Time series between CCAM models are very closed.
# Figure 8
![Figure 8](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure8.png)
## Importance
Figure 8 shows the correlation of soil moisture between CCAM models and BARRA-TA by its annual cycle;
From this, we can see how good work CCAM model did compared with BARRA-TA;
But what is the annual cycle means? It could not be equal to the monthly time series.
## What we expected
We expected that this can do good simulation of CCAM models based on BARRA-TA.
We also expected that this can be the powerful evidence to prove the good performance of CCAM models based on BARRA-TA.
## What we found
Pretty Good performance at the top three layers.
# Figure 9
![Figure 9](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure9.png)
## Importance
It can show the similarity of soil moisture between CCAM models and BARRA-TA.
## What we expected
Good performance, which might have been shown in Figure 8.
## What we found
It is hard to conclude something.
Perhaps, it prove that there are high ratio of grid cells with high confidence between CCAM models and BARRA-TA at the top three layers.
It is also unsure to judge the critical point.
# Figure 10
![Figure 10](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure10.png)
## Importance
It can show the location of the grid cells with varied correlation clearly.
It can provide us the visible output about the correlation over each grid cells.
## What we expected
Clear difference between west and east region.
## What we found
Most grid cells with high correlation are located at the west region, but also need to explain the grid cells in the middle region.
# Figure 11
![Figure 11](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure11.png)
## Importance
To explore the correlation seasonally. And represent the distribution of grid cells with each grid cells through four seasons.
## What we expected
We except to get the seasonal variation of correlation regularly.
## What we found
Irregular distribution over four seasons.
# Figure 12
![Figure 12](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure12.png)
## Importance
* Shows the future change. (wetter or drier?)
* Indicate whether CCAM can provide a good performance.
## What we expected
Significant and regular change.
## What we found
Average time change over different seasons.
Irregular change over seasons become drier.
