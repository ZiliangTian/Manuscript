# Figure 1
![Figure 1](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure1.png)
## Importance
* Represent the difference of soil types between CCAM models and BARRA-TA;
* Indicate than soil texture in the same region might be different between CCAM models and BARRA-TA.
## What we expected
* Similar soil type (soil texture) between CCAM models and BARRA-TA.
## What we found
* Soil type in BARRA is more complicated than in CCAM models;
* The distribution of soil type is different between BARRA-TA and CCAM models.

## Importance
As an example, it can present the relationship between soil moisture and related variables, and present the different relationship between west and east region.
But it doesn't have direct connection with the assessment of soil moisture.
## What we expected
We expect these two figures (Figure 2 and Figure 3) can help us explain the distribution of different correlation between east and west region.
## What we found
We found there is more random and lower values in the east region, and the relationship between soil moisture and the related variables is more random in the east region.
# Figure 4
![Figure 4](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure4.png)
## Importance
It can present the correlation between soil moisture and related variables over each grid cell by the annual cycle.
It can show the relationship between soil moisture and relative variables between different regions and between different models.
Explore the relationship between soil moisture and related variables doesn't have too much help fro assessing soil moisture.
## What we expected
We expect to explore the reason why there are different correlation of soil moisture between west and east region.
But it seems not to convinced.
## What we found
We found that the tendency between soil moisture and the related variables has similar distribution with the tendency of soil moisture between models.
But it is hard to build a confident link between soil moisture and the related variables.
And the CCAM-ensemble's value coule be split into six individual models' value.
# Figure 5
![Figure 5](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure5.png)
## Importance
It can show the high link between soil moisture and related variables.
From this, we could get more understanding about how closed relationship between soil moisture and related variables through different models.
## What we expected
We expected that we can do the statistics about the correlation over all grid cells between models and get more confidence for the relationship between soil moisture and related variables.
## What we found
We only found that there is different weight between models.
And the most we found is the relationship of soil moisture with related variables rather than assessing soil moisture itself.
# Figure 6
![Figure 6](https://github.com/ZiliangTian/Manuscript/blob/master/Figure6.png)
## Importance
This figure shows the average soil moisture values at different layers, models and periods.
Also, it can present the change after layer's transformation.
## What we expected
We excepted the comparison is acceptable after transforming the six original layers into four new layers.
## What we found?
We got that the top two new two layers are more reliable than the bottom two new layers.
And it is acceptable for the transformation from the six layers into four new layers.
