## Importance
* Represent the difference of soil types between CCAM models and BARRA-TA;
* Indicate than soil texture in the same region might be different between CCAM models and BARRA-TA.
## What we expected
* Similar soil type (soil texture) between CCAM models and BARRA-TA.
## What we found
* Soil type in BARRA is more complicated than in CCAM models;
* The distribution of soil type is different between BARRA-TA and CCAM models.
