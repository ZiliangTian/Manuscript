Hi All, there are the two comments from the examiners.

# COMMENT 1

This is a well-argued thesis on the evaluation of soil moisture in a regional climate model (CCAM), evaluated with respect to the BARRA reanalysis.  The literature review is detailed and thought has been given to the organization of the thesis.  The analysis of the regional climate model is performed well and the results have been interpreted with clear strengths and weaknesses.  There is a minor error in the scientific description of the CABLE soil model used by CCAM (e.g., there are more parameters than listed in the table), but this does not have any impact on the analysis on conclusions.    It may have been beneficial to indicate the direction of future work, such as comparing to alternative reanalysis or global climate model products (e.g., how well does CCAM perform compared to a GCM).  Nevertheless, I think this is an impressive honors thesis.

# COMMENT 2

The thesis examines model agreement for soil moisture and other climatological phenomena over the past decade or so and, briefly, examines some climate projections. The thesis is written quite well, but with some English issues which made some parts hard to understand (although the student should be congratulated on writing a thesis in English). The thesis analysis is limited to mainly plotting outputs from models and performing limited temporal and spatial analysis – mainly correlations.
 
The main concern I have is that almost all the analysis is not introduced and so it is left to the reader to guess why certain calculations are being done and what they inform us. In several cases the analysis in the text was brief and just described the major features of the figures rather than adding substantially to them with critical thought. The analysis of the projections in Chapter 2 was very brief.
 
The analysis did not lead me to be confident in the conclusion “Supported by BARRA-TA, CCAM can be confident to project the future change in the region, where the soil moisture will decrease fast (more than 10 % approximately).” This may be the case, but I did not feel the analysis confirmed this, given the differences at the 10% level in soil moisture between the two models (if I understand Figure 6 correctly).
 
Some of the content of Chapter 1 was repeated to some extent in the early parts of Chapter 2.
 
Repetition of content. The abstract was repeated in Chapter 2. Some of the soil moisture content in Chapter 2 is a repeat from Chapter 1. I assume Chapter 1 should have been more general literature review, whereas it is quite specific.
 
Some remaining English issues but entirely understandable in the main. The complex parts of the methods description in Chapter 2.2.3 were, however, too brief, and not precise enough, to understand what occurred at many of the steps. In this section it is stated that correlations are computed by linear regression – something that is not a correct description of how correlations are computed.
 
The discussion of key results in Figures 4 and 5 (Chapter 2) is very limited (just a paragraph or so each). These sentences generally just describe the large scale features rather than delve into what is actually going on. The caption of Figure 5 was not clear enough for me to understand the figure – mainly because the x-axis was not labelled (now I understand – it’s a sort of cumulative plot – it is not clear to me why this is the best way to analyse these data).
 
For Figure 6, again the discussion could have been a little longer. The offset between BARRA-TA and the other models was not commented on for instance. I do not understand what ‘value’ is plotted on the x-axes of Figure 6, and are they normalized or unitless for some other reason? While the soil moisture data are said (in the caption) to come from the middle of the layer, they are plotted at the layer boundary.
 
Figure 7: This is nicely drawn. The effect of moving to from JULES to ACCESS-G in BARRA-TA is large  - the effect of this change suggests a significant sensitivity and it would have been nice to have some more discussion. It would have been nice to flag this right at the beginning and then only show data up to 2014.
 
Figure 8: a discrete (discontinuous) colour scale would have helped the interpretation of this figure
 
Section 2.3.3: the rationale for the calculations reported in this chapter is not explained. This applies to several sections of Chapter 2.
 
Figure 10: it is not clear why 0.9 was adopted as a threshold. The caption refers to it being a ‘critical’ point.
 
Some of the Discussion reads more like conclusions, but overall the discussion is quite good.
 
More minor remarks:
 
The figures in Chapter 2 recommence numbering at Figure 1.
 
The two grid cells discussion in Section 2.3.1 are not shown on a map, so it makes their interpretation impossible. The rationale for choosing these cells, especially the eastern one, is not clear and insufficient evidence is shown to support their choice. I did not understand the sentence about temperature having a smaller range and hence possibly larger correlations (with what? And why?).
 
P42 “Here is the statistics of the spatial pattern of these correlations.” is not a complete sentence.
 
Figure 2 (Chapter 2) caption is not entirely clear. It suggest percentages but then says they are rescaled (which I think means normalized to 0-1) but this is not clear. It is not clear how the normalization was performed.
 
Figure 10 is referenced in the text before Figure 9.
